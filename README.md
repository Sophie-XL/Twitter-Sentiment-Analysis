Twitter Sentiment Analysis on COVID-19 Pandemic
Smith Analytics Consortium (SAC) -Deloitte Data Series Workshop: COVID-19 Tweets Analysis for Government Responses

July 9 to August 14, 2020

The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted summer internship plans for many Maryland Smith graduate students, so the SAC and Deloitte Data Scientists came together to host a one-month-long Data Series Workshop to enrich students’ data analysis skills and make a difference in the unprecedented pandemic.

Deloitte hosted four workshops on various topics focused on Natural Language Processing. The students had the chance to learn not only basic NLP techniques, such as Tokenization, Vectorization, Extracting Features, etc. but also learn about advanced topics, such as Sentiment and Clustering Analysis. Applying the skills to real-world data, which includes 20M COVID-19 related Tweets from March-May 2020 in the U.S., the students provided insightful data-driven evaluations and recommendations as reports regarding the government’s response to the pandemic.

Each of our Top 4 reports provided their insights from a different perspective. Do mask-wearing and stay-at-home orders slow down the spreading of Coronavirus? You can find the answer from the report of Group 3, by Cindy (Li-Hsin) Chang, Qiong Chen, Wenjing Jiang, and Yiyang Wang. What are the most popular topics people discuss during the pandemic? Weibo Chen, Xiaohui (Sophie) Li, Yifan He, and Madhavi Mundada found some interesting topics in their report (report of Group 6). Alexander Binder, Jinxin Hou, Hsiaoting Ko, Suchit Sanghvi, and Neerja Singh (report of Group 8) provided their insights about how the government should respond to a future pandemic. What public figure do tweets mention the most in relation to the pandemic? What are the most mentioned groups and organizations? Find your answer in the report of Group 9, Hao Jiang.

This data series workshop hosted by Deloitte was a valuable experience for Maryland Smith students, and a good replacement for some summer internships lost to the COVID-19 pandemic. The SAC looks forward to partnering with Deloitte again to benefit our students.
